# Casio 2747 Instructions

The Casio 2747 is a dual analog/digital watch. The 2747 has a metal band and a black face, with the digital portion of the watch appearing at the bottom of the face and stretching from the “8” to the “4.” The digital portion of the watch has many functions and can display a lot of information, all of which is controlled by the button system on the watch.

## Setting Analog Time

The 2747 has an analog and a digital timepiece on the face of the watch, each of which has a different method for setting the time. To set the analog time, press the lower left button six times to enter “Hand Setting Mode” and control the hands of the watch. Press and hold the top left button until the digital display blinks. Next, press the lower right button to advance the time 20 seconds. If you hold down the lower right button, the analog time setting will advance at a higher rate of speed.

Once the correct time is set, press the top left button and then the lower left button to set the watch.

## Setting Digital Time

To set the digital timepiece on the 2747, press and hold the top left button until the seconds start blinking on the display. You now have control of the digital time and can make your changes. By pressing the lower left button you can move the hours, minutes and seconds of the digital time, as well as the date. When a section is blinking, press the right buttons to increase or decrease the value until the correct time is set. Once the time is set, press the upper left button to save the setting.
Setting Alarm

The 2747 allows for three alarm settings, one of which has a snooze function, while the other two are one-time alarms. All three alarms can be set at once and are controlled in the digital timepiece of the watch. To set the alarms, press the lower left button until “SNZ” is visible in the digital display. Press the lower right button to switch between the different alarm types. “SNZ” is the snooze alarm and “AL1” and “AL2” are the one-time alarm type. Select the alarm type and hold down the upper left button until the hour starts blinking. Press the right buttons to change the hour and then press the lower left button, which will make the minutes blink. Use the right buttons to change the minute setting. When complete, press the upper left button to save the setting.
